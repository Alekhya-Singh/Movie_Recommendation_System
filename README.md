Recommendation System using ALS, Cosine Similarity and Demographic filtering

Data is growing rapidly which leads to a new era of information. More efficient systems are being created by using the data and Recommendation System is one of them. 
Recommendation System is a type of information filtering system as it improves the quality of exploration results and provides items that are more appropriate to the search item or are related to the search history of the user.

A recommender system refers to a system that is proficient to predict the future preference of a set of items for a user and recommend the top items. The need for a recommender system in modern society has become important as people have too many options to use from due to the pervasiveness of the Internet. In the older times, people used to shop personally in a store, in which the items available are limited. For instance, the number of movies that can be stored in a bestseller store depends on the size of that store. On the contrary, nowadays, the Internet allows people to access ample resources online. Netflix, for example, has an enormous collection of movies. Although the amount of available information increased and is keep on increasing day by day which arose a new problem for people to select the items they actually want to see. To overcome this problem, the recommender system came into existence. Two different ways of building a recommender system are introduced in this report that is; collaborative filtering and content-based filtering. 

To improve the quality of a movie recommendation system, a Hybrid approach by combining content-based filtering and collaborative filtering can be used. In the proposed methodology Hybrid approach helps to get the advantages from both the approaches as well as tries to eliminate the drawbacks of both methods.
